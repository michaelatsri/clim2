The Common Lisp Interface Manager
=================================

Description
-----------

The contents of this repo are known to compile and work in
Allegro CL 8.2 and later.  No work has been done to make it work on
other Common Lisps, even though there is considerable
conditionalization for many other CLs.

See the file LICENSE for information on the license for this source
code.


To build at a clim using an mlisp at a non-Franz-Inc site:

 1. There are a number of Makefile.nonfranz.x files (where x is
    a particular architecture and/or operating system) in the makefile.templates
    direcotry.  Select one that is closest and modify for your needs, and copy
    or create a new one for your specific machine and os.  Modify paths needed for
    mlisp programs and images, as nneeded.

 2. On the local clim2 direcotry on your machine, link the selected or created
    file to Makefile.nonfranz, e.g.:

      ln -s makefile.templates/Makefile.nonfranz.macosarm64 Makefile.nonfranz

   If you are working on Windows, and don't use Cygwin, you may have to copy the
   selected makefile, rather than soft-linking it, because Windows does not itself
   support soft-links.

 3. Type

      make clean
      make
